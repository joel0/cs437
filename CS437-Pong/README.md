# Com S 437 Project 1A -- Pong

## Overview
This is a game of Pong.  Player 1 is on the left; player 2 is on the right.  The
goal is simple: do not let the ball past your paddle.

## Controls
### Keyboard
Keyboard controls are mapped to physical key locations rather than characters,
so people with Dvorak, Workman, AZERTY, Colemak, etc. can enjoy this game of
Pong.

On a QWERTY keyboard the controls are as follows.  
Player 1: W -> up, S -> down  
Player 2: up arrow -> up, down arrow -> down

### Controller
Supports 0, 1, or 2 controllers.  I was only able to test with 1 controller.
The left analogue stick controls the player's paddle.
